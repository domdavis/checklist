        This page allows you to learn a little about how the checklists work.
        Most checks are handled with a slider. A checked slider will usually go
        green.
    - name: "Click Slider"
      check: "CLICKED"
      notes: "Click the slider to mark the item as checked"
    - memo: >-
        Some checks may try to use external data. If this is unavailable then
        the slider will turn blue when checked. All this means is some later
        checks may require more manual components and calculations.
    - name: "Click Slider"
      check: "CLICKED"
      id: "blue"
    - memo: >-
        If there is an error when retrieving external data the slider will turn
        yellow when checked. All this means is some later checks may require
        more manual components and calculations.
    - name: "Click Slider"
      check: "CLICKED"
      id: "yellow"
    - memo: >-
        Sometimes information needs to be recorded for later use. The below is
        an example and can be ignored.
    - name: "Notes"
      label: "AS REQ"
      input:
        id: "temp"
        label: "Note"
        placeholder: "Data being noted"
  - name: "More Checks"
    id: "more"
    actions:
      - memo: >-
          Checks are split into logical groups to allow you to complete each set
          of checks before moving on. This tutorial only has two sets of checks.
          Congratulations, you are now done!
